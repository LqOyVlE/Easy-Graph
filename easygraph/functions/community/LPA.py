def LPA(G):
    '''Detect community by label propagation algotithm

    Return the detected communities. But the result is random.

    Each node in the network is initially assigned to its own community. At every iteration,nodes have
    a label that the maximum number of their neighbors have. If there are more than one nodes fit and 
    available, choose a label randomly. Finally, nodes having the same labels are grouped together as 
    communities. In case two or more disconnected groups of nodes have the same label, we run a simple 
    breadth-first search to separate the disconnected communities

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A easygraph graph

    Returns
    ----------
    communities : dictionary
      key: serial number of community , value: nodes in the community.

def HANP(G, m, delta):
    '''Detect community by Hop attenuation & node preference algotithm

    Return the detected communities. But the result is random.

    Implement the basic HANP algorithm to give more freedom, but also provide the choice to use 
    geodesic distance as the measure(instead of receiving the current hop scores from the neighborhood 
    and carry out a subtraction). If you want to use geodesic distance as score measure, see 
    the comment in the middle of code.

    Compared to paper[1], one feature didn't unimplemented is the second proposal in "Hierarchical and 
    overlapping communities" session in paper[1]. It treats newly combined communities as a single node.
    Another feature unimplemented is the Optimization part in paper[1]. It does make sense that by updating 
    nodes whose number of neighbors sharing the maximal label is less than a certain percentage we can save 
    the running time.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A easygraph graph
    m : 
      when m > 0, more preference is given to node with more neighbors; m < 0, less
    delta :
      Hop attenuation

    Returns
    ----------
    communities : dictionary
      key: serial number of community , value: nodes in the community.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> HANP(G,
    ...     m = 0.1, 
    ...     delta = 0.05
    ...     )
