def LPA(G):
    '''Detect community by label propagation algotithm

    Return the detected communities. But the result is random.

    Each node in the network is initially assigned to its own community. At every iteration,nodes have
    a label that the maximum number of their neighbors have. If there are more than one nodes fit and 
    available, choose a label randomly. Finally, nodes having the same labels are grouped together as 
    communities. In case two or more disconnected groups of nodes have the same label, we run a simple 
    breadth-first search to separate the disconnected communities

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A easygraph graph

    Returns
    ----------
    communities : dictionary

def HANP(G, m, delta, threshod = 1):
    '''Detect community by Hop attenuation & node preference algotithm

    Return the detected communities. But the result is random.

    Implement the basic HANP algorithm and give more freedom through the parameters, e.g., you can use threshod 
    to set the condition for node updating. You can choose geodesic distance as the measure(instead of receiving the current hop scores 
    from the neighborhood and carry out a subtraction) and When an equilibrium is reached, treat newly combined 
    communities as a single node. If you want to use geodesic distance as score measure, see the comment in the middle of code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A easygraph graph
    m : float
      used to calculate score, when m > 0, more preference is given to node with more neighbors; m < 0, less
    delta : float
      Hop attenuation
    threshod : float 
      Between 0 and 1, only update node whose number of neighbors sharing the maximal label is less than the threshod.
      e.g., threshod == 1 means updating all nodes. 

    Returns
    ----------
    communities : dictionary
      key: serial number of community , value: nodes in the community.

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> HANP(G,
    ...     m = 0.1, 
    ...     delta = 0.05,
    ...     threshod = 1
